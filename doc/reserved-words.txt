# Reserved Words

Reserved words are simple commands that control the basic behavior of the _study_.


## Parsing the Web Documentation

Using Chrome Dev Tools, I selected the element such that `<ul class="childlist"> == $0`.  

(For some reason attempting the same through `document.getElementsByClassname("childlist")` did not 
achieve the same results.  I'll have to look for what I did wrong some other time.)

```
reserved_words = $0
reserved_words_array = Array.from(reserved_words.children)
var results = reserved_words_array.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element.innerText);
    console.log(element.firstElementChild.href);
    console.log('\n');
})
```

Which produced the following list.  _(Actually, I r-clicked in the console, selected "Save as", and then cleaned up 
this file with some vim macros.  I should be able to make that all a bit easier.)_
